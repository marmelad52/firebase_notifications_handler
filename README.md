# üõ´ Migration Guides

## Migration Guide from v1.x to v2.x+

### 1. Renaming of Parameters and Callbacks
Several parameters and callbacks were renamed for clarity and consistency:
- `NotificationTapDetails` is now `NotificationInfo`.
- `onFCMTokenInitialize` is now `onFcmTokenInitialize`.
- `onFCMTokenUpdate` is now `onFcmTokenUpdate`.
- `initializeFCMToken` is now `initializeFcmToken`.
- `requestPermissionsOnInit` is now `requestPermissionsOnInitialize`.
- `AppState.closed` is now `AppState.terminated`.

### 2. Context and Navigator Key Removal
- **Navigator Key**: The `navigatorKey` parameter is no longer available in `onTap` and `onOpenNotificationArrive`. You‚Äôll need to manage your own navigator key in your app. See the [example](https://github.com/rithik-dev/firebase_notifications_handler/blob/master/example) app for more details on handling navigation.
- **Context**: Callbacks such as `onFcmTokenInitialize` and `onFcmTokenUpdate` no longer accept `context`. Ensure that any context-dependent logic is refactored.

### 3. Handling of Notifications
- **NotificationInfo**: The class `NotificationTapDetails` has been renamed to `NotificationInfo`. This class now includes the `firebaseMessage` parameter, providing more comprehensive information.
- `onTap` and `onOpenNotificationArrive` now return a `NotificationInfo` object, replacing the previous payload. The payload can still be accessed using the `payload` property of `NotificationInfo`.
- The `notificationArrivesSubscription` stream now returns `NotificationInfo` instead of just the payload.

### 4. Local Notifications Configuration
The configuration of local notifications has been refactored to use platform-specific getters in `LocalNotificationsConfiguration`:
- Android-specific parameters like `channelId`, `channelName`, and `sound` have been moved to `localNotificationsConfiguration.androidConfig`.
- iOS-specific parameters like `sound` have been moved to `localNotificationsConfiguration.iosConfig`.
- The `notificationIdGetter` function is now also part of the `LocalNotificationsConfiguration`.

### 5. FCM Token Changes
- The callback `onFCMTokenRefresh` has been removed. Use `onFcmTokenUpdate` instead to handle token updates.
- If you need to maintain your own stream of FCM tokens, you can do so manually in your app.

### 6. Notification Sending
- **Removed**: `sendFcmNotification` has been deprecated for sending notifications from the client side. You'll now need to send notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) server-side APIs.
- **New**: A new `sendLocalNotification` function is introduced, which allows sending or scheduling local notifications.

### 7. Other Notable Changes
- New streams `notificationTapsSubscription` and `notificationArrivesSubscription` are available for handling notification taps and arrivals.
- Android notification channel management methods have been added: create, read, and delete channels.
- New callbacks and getters such as `permissionGetter`, `shouldHandleNotification`, `messageModifier`, and `stateKeyGetter` are introduced for finer control over the notification lifecycle.
- Logging is now available in debug mode for better debugging.
- Fixed issues with images not displaying in notifications.
- `getInitialMessage` callback added for retrieving the initial notification that launched the app.

### 8. Updated Example App and Documentation
- The [example](https://github.com/rithik-dev/firebase_notifications_handler/blob/master/example) app has been updated to use the latest SDKs and demonstrates how to implement these breaking changes.
- Documentation has been updated to reflect all changes, along with the issue tracker link for reporting bugs or issues.

For more details, refer to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/rithik-dev/firebase_notifications_handler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200).

# üöÄ Getting Started

## Step 1: Create Firebase Project
Create a Firebase project. Learn more about Firebase projects [**here**](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more).

## Step 2: Register your apps and configure Firebase
Add your Android & iOS apps to your Firebase project and configure the Firebase the apps by following the setup instructions for [Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android) and [iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios) separately.

## Step 3: Add firebase_core dependency
Add [`firebase_core`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_core) as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  firebase_core:
```

## Step 4: Initialize Firebase
Call `Firebase.initializeApp()` in the `main()` method as shown to intialize Firebase in your project.

```dart
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

# üõ†Ô∏è Platform-Specific Setup



## Android
> [!NOTE]
> Refer to the platform specific setup for local notifications [here](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications#-android-setup)
1. Add the following meta-data tags (if required) to define default values in `AndroidManifest.xml` under the `<application>` tag:
```xml
<!-- Can add a default notification channel (if not sending a channel id when sending notification) -->
<!-- If you don't specify a default channel id, and don't pass an id when sending notification, Android creates a default channel "Miscellaneous" -->
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_channel_id"
    android:value="default" />

<!-- Use the following tags if you need to different icons or color for app icon -->
<!-- <meta-data
    android:name="com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_icon"
    android:resource="@drawable/notification_icon" />

<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_color"
    android:resource="@color/notification_color" /> -->
```

2. Add this `<intent-filter>` in the `<activity>` tag:
```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="FLUTTER_NOTIFICATION_CLICK" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
</intent-filter>
```

## iOS
> [!NOTE]
> Refer to the platform specific setup for local notifications [here](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications#-ios-setup)

---

# ‚ùì Usage

1. Add [`firebase_notifications_handler`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_notifications_handler) as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  firebase_notifications_handler:
```

2. Wrap the `FirebaseNotificationsHandler` widget ideally as a parent widget on the `MaterialApp` to enable your application to receive notifications.
```dart
import 'package:firebase_notifications_handler/firebase_notifications_handler.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FirebaseNotificationsHandler(
      child: MaterialApp(),
    );
  }
}
```

Although, the widget automatically initializes the FCM token, but if the FCM token is needed before the widget is built, use the `FirebaseNotificationsHandler.initializeFcmToken()` function to initialize the token, which will initialize and return initialized token. This will also trigger the `onFCMTokenInitialize` callback.

3. Explore the widget [documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/firebase_notifications_handler/latest/firebase_notifications_handler/FirebaseNotificationsHandler-class.html), and see the different configurations available, allowing you to customize each and every bit of your notifications.
```dart
FirebaseNotificationsHandler(
  localNotificationsConfiguration: LocalNotificationsConfiguration(
    androidConfig: AndroidNotificationsConfig(
      // ...
    ),
    iosConfig: IosNotificationsConfig(
      // ...
    ),
  ),
  onOpenNotificationArrive: (info) {
    log(
      id,
      msg: 'Notification received while app is open with payload ${info.payload}',
    );
  },
  onTap: (info) {
    final payload = info.payload;
    final appState = info.appState;
    final firebaseMessage = info.firebaseMessage;

    // If you want to push a screen on notification tap
    //
    // Globals.navigatorKey.currentState?.pushNamed(payload['screenId']);
    //
    // OR
    ///
    // Get current context
    // final context = Globals.navigatorKey.currentContext!;

    log(
      id,
      msg: 'Notification tapped with $appState & payload $payload. Firebase message: $firebaseMessage',
    );
  },
  onFcmTokenInitialize: (token) => Globals.fcmTokenNotifier.value = token,
  onFcmTokenUpdate: (token) => Globals.fcmTokenNotifier.value = token,
  // ...
);
```  
    
## Creating notification channels for Android
By default, if you send a notification, the device will automatically create a notification channel with the passed `channelId`, but the priority for that channel will be normal, and the notification will not show up as a popup.

Creating a default channel lets you set the priorty to `high` and also give you more customization of the channels like setting a custom notification sound, setting vibration patterns etc.
```dart
FirebaseNotificationsHandler.createAndroidNotificationChannel(
  const AndroidNotificationChannel(
    'marketing',
    'Marketing',
    description: 'Notification channel for marketing',
    playSound: true,
    importance: Importance.max,
    sound: RawResourceAndroidNotificationSound('marketing'),
  ),
);
```

It is recommended to create notification channels as soon as the app starts, as the custom sounds will not play if the channel is not created for the first time, and it might cause issues with other parameters as well.
```dart
FirebaseNotificationsHandler.createAndroidNotificationChannels([
  const AndroidNotificationChannel(
    'promotions',
    'Promotions',
    description: 'Notification channel for promotions',
    playSound: true,
    importance: Importance.max,
    sound: RawResourceAndroidNotificationSound('chime'),
  ),
  const AndroidNotificationChannel(
    'order-updates',
    'Order Updates',
    description: 'Notification channel for order updates',
    playSound: true,
    importance: Importance.max,
    sound: RawResourceAndroidNotificationSound('elevator'),
  ),
  const AndroidNotificationChannel(
    'messages',
    'Messages',
    description: 'Notification channel for messages',
    playSound: true,
    importance: Importance.max,
    sound: RawResourceAndroidNotificationSound('bell'),
  ),
]);
```

## Adding custom sound files in platform-specific folders

### Android
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Add a [keep.xml](https://github.com/rithik-dev/firebase_notifications_handler/tree/master/example/android/app/src/main/res/raw/keep.xml) file in the `android/app/src/main/res/raw/` folder, as flutter strips off the `raw` folder when compiling app in release mode, and hence the custom sounds won't work in release mode.

* Add the audio file in the `android/app/src/main/res/raw/` folder.  

### iOS
- Add the audio file in the `ios/Runner/Resources/` folder.

# üí° Solutions to common issues
## Notification not showing as a pop up on Android device: 
On Android devices, a notification channel by default when a notification arrives, but that might not have the priority set to high. The notification only shows up as a popup if the channel you're sending it to has priority set as "high". We can solve this issue by creating a notification channel on app start using:
```dart
FirebaseNotificationsHandler.createAndroidNotificationChannel(
  const AndroidNotificationChannel(
    'default',
    'Default',
    importance: Importance.high,
  ),
);
```

## Custom sound not playing when notification received on Android device:
On Android devices, a notification channel by default when a notification arrives, but that won't have the sound set to it by default. The sound will only play if the channel was creating while specifying the custom sound you want to play for that channel. 
> [!NOTE]
> You cannot modify a channel's sound after it's created. Only way is to either use a new channel id or delete an existing channel using `FirebaseNotificationsHandler.deleteAndroidNotificationChannel(String channelId);` and creating a new one with the new sound. Or try uninstalling the app and creating the channel again.  

We can solve this issue by creating a notification channel on app start and passing in the sound using:
```dart
FirebaseNotificationsHandler.createAndroidNotificationChannel(
  const AndroidNotificationChannel(
    'default',
    'Default',
    playSound: true,
    importance: Importance.high,
    sound: RawResourceAndroidNotificationSound('pop'),
  ),
);
```

## Notification image not showing if app in background or terminated even when passed on Android device:
The max size for a notification to be displayed by firebase on an Android device is 1MB ([Source](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/send-image#:~:text=Images%20for%20notifications%20are%20limited,by%20native%20Android%20image%20support.)). So, if an image exceeds this size, it is not shown in the notification. However, if the app is in foreground, then there is no size limitation as then it's handled by local notifications.

## Custom sounds in Android work in debug mode but not in release mode:
Flutter strips off the `raw` folder during compiling build for release mode. We can add a file [keep.xml](https://github.com/rithik-dev/firebase_notifications_handler/tree/master/example/android/app/src/main/res/raw/keep.xml) in the raw folder, which tells flutter to not strip off the raw folder, and hence fixing the issue.
